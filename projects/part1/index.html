                    <p>Statistics in soccer is now more important than ever before with trying to help improve a player. The goal of this website is to be able to input soccer stats of any player to see what they need to work on in their own development. This website can be used by an amateur Sunday League player to a professional playing at a top European soccer club. This website will be able to determine what area of their game they need to work on (passing, dribbling, finishing, etc). With taking their past games average and comparing to the average statistics of a professional player, players will be able to compare themselves and know what to focus on in their development. In addition, there will be a page of top professional players and team stats where everyone can access and view.
